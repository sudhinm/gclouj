## Usage

* Set environment variable ***GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS*** as path to credentials to connect to the bigquery. You can generate the service account key file (json) from GCP Console.
> GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/Users/pingles/gcp/credentials.json


* Add dependency in your ***project.clj*** file.
> :dependencies [[gclouj/bigquery "0.2.6.0"]]

* import the framework
> (:requre [gclouj/bigquery :as bigquery])
* Create service to perform operations
```clojure
(bigquery/service {:keys [project-id], :as options})
```
* Query
```
Executes a query. BigQuery will create a Query Job and block for the specified timeout. If the query returns within the time the results will be returned. Otherwise, results need to be retrieved separately using query-results. Status of the job can be checked using the job function, and checking completed?
```
```clojure
(query service
       query
       {:keys [max-results dry-run? max-wait-millis use-cache?
               default-dataset],
        :as query-opts})
```
* Query-results
```
Retrieves results in raw sequence for a Query job. Will throw exceptions unless Job has completed successfully. Check using job and completed? functions.
```
```clojure
(query-results service
               {:keys [project-id job-id], :as job}
               &
               {:keys [max-wait-millis], :as opts})
```
* Query-results-seq
```clojure
(query-results-seq {:keys [results schema], :as query-results})
```
```
Takes a query result and coerces the results from being raw sequences into maps according to the schema and coercing values according to their type. e.g.: converts from query results of: {:results (("500")) :schema ({:name "col" :type :integer})} into... ({"col" 500} ...)
```
